# Merge requirements

## Handle conflicts:
- same depedancy with version and without -> wins the one with version ? IDK
- same depedancy wih 2 different versions -> wins the one with the newer version? NO the earliest ?
- **Deal with mulitple versions**

# Merge imports

## Handle conflicts:
- import pandas as pd vs import pandas pan -> OK to have multiple aliases
- same module but different function -> merge on the same line

# Other
- Why is there 2 different locations for requirements -> **Just Ignore utils/tracing/.**
